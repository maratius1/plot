# Plot

.Net Object Graph Mapper for Neo4j

## Install With NuGet

    install-package Plot.Neo4j

## Overview
Plot is an application framework designed to assist in managing CRUD operations for an application domain backed by a graph database. Plot is not designed to cover all features of the Neo4j data store, for that it is best to look at the [Neo4jClient](https://github.com/Readify/Neo4jClient) project.
